## Monte Carlo Simulation for Projections of epidemiological burden of Chronic Disease and evaluation of impact of changes in risk factor distribution for a given year

This package includes estimHI function for estimate projections of several indicators of a chronic disease in a given year and varHI function for provide the variability of these estimations.
The estimDementia function can compute several health indicators for dementia in France in a given year and FrenchDementia can compute these indicators with the impact of changes in risk factors distribution.
